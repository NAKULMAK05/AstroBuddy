## How It Works

AstroBuddy leverages modern web technologies and APIs to provide real-time astronomy information and interactive features. Here is a breakdown of how it functions:

1. **User Location Access:**

   - Uses the Geolocation API to fetch the user's current latitude and longitude.
   - Provides location-specific stargazing data and celestial maps.

2. **Sky Mapping:**

   - Renders a dynamic sky map using libraries like `three.js` for 3D visualization.
   - Combines astronomical data to display constellations, planets, and other celestial bodies in their real-time positions.

3. **AR Navigation:**

   - Integrates AR.js or WebXR to enable augmented reality-based celestial navigation.
   - Displays overlays for celestial objects when viewed through the device camera.

4. **Celestial Data Fetching:**

   - Uses APIs like NASA Open APIs, Stellarium API, or Skyfield for retrieving accurate astronomical data.
   - Displays detailed information about stars, constellations, and planetary movements.

5. **User Interaction:**

   - Provides an intuitive UI for selecting celestial objects and getting information.
   - Allows users to search for specific objects or events and navigate to them using AR.
